<h1 class="mt-4">About</h1>
<img class="headshot" src="images/stephen.jpg">


<p>I co-founded <a href="http://www.parallaxinfotech.com">Parallax Information Technology</a> 1996 and have been working with Drupal for ten years and building websites for more than twenty.  I'm currently working on Drupal projects with the US Government.</p>

<p>Born in Boston, MA and raised in Bristol RI, I recently moved back to Bristol.</p>

<p>What started as two guys, Jason Pamental and myself, having coffee and talking tech, turned into a book club, and then the <a href="http://www.talkingdrupal.com">Talking Drupal Podcast</a>.   The first episode was recorded in 2013 with Jason, John Picozzi, and Nic Laflin.   Three of us are still at it today!</p>

<p>With a desire to grow a strong Drupal community in the RI area, I reached out to the same guys to help start the <a href="http://www.nedcamp.org">New England Drupal Camp</a>.   In 2014, the first NEDCamp was held at Brown University.   Local Drupal events are the best way to get involved with the community and continue professional development.</p>

<p>Early in my career  I created developer training curriculum and taught courses.   With an itch to teach again, in 2018 I launched <a href="http://www.thinkingdrupal.com">Thinking Drupal</a> where I offer Drupal training.  I look forward to see where this will go in the future.</p>

<p><b>Family:</b>  Erica, my awesome wife of 28 years, and I have two daughters, <a href="https://www.essentiallyholisticliving.com">Meghan</a> and <a href="https://www.adventureindeparture.com">Allison</a>.    Toni and Abby, our cats, keep the house interesting when the girls are away.</p>

<p><b>Mac or PC:</b>  I was a MAC until recently <a href="/blog/2018/09/18/from-mac-to-linux/">switching to Linux</a>.   I'm currently using PopOS! on System76 hardware for development.</p>

<p><b>Hobbies:</b>  I wish I could be a more rounded person. Believe me, I've tried.  I'm currently tinkering with SBCs (single board computers).</p>

<p><b>Favorite Band:</b>  While I love music of all shapes and sizes, Rush is my #1 of all time.   My company name comes from a lyric in Roll the Bones, "It's a parallax, you dig".</p>
