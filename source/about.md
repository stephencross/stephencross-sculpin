# About

I live in Rhode Island.  I've been building websites, bigs one and small ones, for 18+ years.   I currently work with Drupal, and love it. 

My company, since 1996, is [Parallax Information Technology](http://www.parallaxinfotech.com).

I host a Drupal Podcast called [Talking Drupal](http://www.talkingdrupal.com).

I organized the [New England Drupal Camp](http://www.nedcamp.org), an annual Drupal conference.
