I have roots in technology training.    While in college, my professors ask me to fill in for him teaching a one-day DOS training at the Brown University Learning Community.   I continued instructing that course on a regular basis.      I then created the Clipper Bootcamp; four consecutive Saturday's for dBase programmers that wanted to take it to the next level.   As a senior consultant at Progress Software, I created dtraining curriculum around their SmartObject platform.   Over recent years my training itch has been scratched with the Talking Drupal podcast and speaking at local meetups and camps.
 
I'm excited to teach again.  I've recently created a training program to introduce Drupal.  [Getting Started with Drupal](https://www.thinkingdrupal.com/courses/getting-started-with-drupal) is a five-week course delivered with a combination of self-passed lessons and face-to-face classroom discussion.   The first offering in 2019 is from Jan 4 to Feb 8.  

Getting Started with Drupal is the first course available at [Thinking Drupal](https://www.thinkingdrupal.com), a new learning platform for everything Drupal.   You can stay updated about new Thinking Drupal offerings by registering for updates at [Thinking Drupal](https://www.thinkingdrupal.com).  I'm just getting started!

I'm looking forward to sharing my Drupal experience and learning more myself!
