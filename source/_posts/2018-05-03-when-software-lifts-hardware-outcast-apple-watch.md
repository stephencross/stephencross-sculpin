Over the past year, I’ve prioritized exercise in my life, most days spending an hour outside or at the gym. I take advantage of that time to listen to podcasts and audiobooks. It took two devices to make this work for me, a health tracker (Fitbit) and phone (iPhone).

While I had wanted an Apple Watch since it’s introduction, having the ability to leave your phone behind made the Series 3, released in October 2017, a compelling product. I upgraded my Fitbit to an Apple Watch, [Series 3 Cellular](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-3/), shortly after its release.

My dreams of untethering from my iPhone during my 3.5-mile walk vanished quickly. While the Series 3 Cellar Apple Watch works well without my phone, it doesn’t support podcast playback from Apple’s Podcast app, and Apple has not made it easy for developers to create podcast apps. In fact, the podcast app I use, Overcast, [removed their support](https://marco.org/2017/08/10/removed-send-to-watch) for Apple Watch with the release of watchOS 4. Also, there is no Audible playback on the Apple Watch.

I was happy with my move from Fitbit to Apple Watch, but I was still talking my phone with me, which is frustrating when I have a capable computer on my wrist. I tried a few apps claiming to support podcast playback on the Apple Watch, but they were too hard to use and very unreliable.

Then along came [Outcast](https://crunchybagel.com/outcast-for-apple-watch/)! While not perfect, the folks at Crunchy Bagel battled through Apple’s developer limitations and created an app that works. While Outcast allows you to search and enter podcast feeds to the app manually, I was able to import my existing podcast list from my podcast App Overcast. In a few minutes, I was running the bike path, listening to the Vector with Rene Richie podcast while my iPhone was on the charger at home.

A $.99 app lifted the value of my Apple Watch, to me.

I now wait for Apple to provide the watchOS features developers need to create a quality experience. Hey Audible, what up?
